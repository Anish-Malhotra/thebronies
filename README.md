<br>
This tool allows you to find beers based on alcohol content.
<br>
First, input an ABV between 2% and 20% (the form accepts integers as well as doubles).
<br>
After submitting, you will be taken to a list of beers that match the alcohol content you selected.
<br>
Each beer listing has a descrition (if available), a style type and description (if available), as well as the beer ID in case you want to look it up on the BreweryDB API website.
<br>
Click on the name of the beer to find out the closest brewery to Stuy that serves that beer. You can see a Google Map and click on it to find out directions, or you can click on the brewery name to be taken to the brewery's website (if available).
